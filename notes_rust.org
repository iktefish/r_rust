* Create ~cargo~ package
To create a new Rust project, enter the following command in your shell.

#+begin_src shell :noeval
cargo new $NameOfPackage --bin
#+end_src

* Compilation
Unlike Java, Rust doesnt compile to bytecode and run on a VM. Instead Rust compiles
directly to machine code or web assembly.
** Cross compilation
Currently Rust doesnt support cross compilation. This means if you are on
Linux and want to compile for Windows, or vice-versa, you cant. You will
have to compile the source code on the specific platform you want the binary
to be executed in.
* Function declaration
NOTE:
+ All functions in Rust are required to specify a return type
  (for ~fn main(){}~ check [[#the-unit-tuple][The ~Unit~ tuple]])

#+begin_src rust
fn main(){
    println!("Hello World!");
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World!

* Null/Nil/Undefined
Rust doesnt possess the concept of ~null~, ~nil~, or ~undefined~.
* Macros
Macros a way to do something that works a bit like a function call, but rather
than calling a function its doing come code transforation instead.

NOTE:
+ Macros are almost always more powerful than functions with only one limitation,
  they cannot be passed around like functions since they are evaluated at compile
  time
+ There is performance difference between Macros and Functions but only at compile
  time and not at runtime

Macros end with ~!~.

For example: the ~println!()~ takes the arguments we give it and translates
them, at compile time, into some number of other function calls.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;

    println!("x plus y is {}", x + y);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: x plus y is 15

In the above code block, the ~println!()~ macro will allocate memory for the string,
add the two variables, convert the integers into a string and concactenate the result
to the string.
** Panic
To end the program. None of the code that comes after the ~panic()~ statement
eill be executed.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let crash_reason = "Server feels sleepy!!!";
    panic!("Oooops! I crashed! {}", crash_reason);
    println!("Hello there, I cant run");
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: thread 'main' panicked at 'Oooops! I crashed! Server feels sleepy!!!', src/main.rs:4:5

* Statements
A statement does not evaluate to a value. For example the ~println!()~
macro doesnt evaluate to a value and is thus statement. Statements will
end with ~;~.
* Expressions
An expression is something that always evaluates to a value.
Below ~my_number > 1000~ is an expression that returns a boolean
based on whether the expression is true or false.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let my_number = 300;
    println!("{}", my_number > 1000);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: false

NOTE:
In ~some_variable > func(arg)~:
+ The variable ~some_variable~ is an expression
+ The argument ~arg~ is an expression
+ The function call ~func(arg)~ is an expression

The distinction between expression and statement is important BCUZ the compiler
can automatically return the last expression in a function. Remember to
not put the ~;~ in the expression that the function is supposed to return.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    println!("With return statement {}",ret_product_of(10, 233));
    println!("Without return statement {}",product_of(10, 233));
}

fn ret_product_of(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    return x * y;
}

fn product_of(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x * y
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: With return statement 2330
: Without return statement 2330

* Interpolation
NOTE:
+ Any expression can be interpolated

Rust requires variables to be interpolated in order to print them out.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hello";
    let subject = "World";

    println!("{}, {}!", greeting, subject);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!

Format interpolated variables similar to the above code block but returns the output as a string.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let subject = "World";
    let greeting = format!("Hello, {}!", subject);

    println!("{}", greeting);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!

* Mutability
In Rust ~let~ works somewhat similarly to ~const~ in JavaScript. But unlike JavaScript,
variables assigned with ~let~ cannot be reassigned nor can they be mutated.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1.1;
    x = 2.2;
}
#+end_src

NOTE:
+ The point of immutable variables is "good programming practices" as they are less
  error prone and easier for the coder to debug

#+begin_src text
  error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
  --> src/main.rs:4:5
 |
  3 |     let x = 1.1;
 |         -
 |         |
 |         first assignment to `x`
 |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
  4 |     x = 2.2;
 |     ^^^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
#+end_src

To mutate an immutable variable, we must use the ~mut~ keyword.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 1.1;
    println!("Unchanged x -> {}", x);
    x = 2.2;
    println!("Changed x -> {}", x);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Unchanged x -> 1.1
: Changed x -> 2.2

* Types
Rust is a *Static Type Checked* language similar to C++.

Types assigned to a variable cannot be changed during runtime. Values can be
changed but only so long as the new value if of the same type.

#+begin_src rust :exports both
fn main() {
    let mut x = 2.2;
    x = 3.1;
    x = "Lets sneak in a stringgg";
}
#+end_src

** Different types
[[#int-unsigned-int-float][Int]]:
+ i8
+ i16
+ i32
+ i64
+ i128

[[#int-unsigned-int-float][Unsigned Int]]:
+ u8
+ u16
+ u32
+ u64
+ u128

[[#int-unsigned-int-float][Float]]:
+ f32
+ f64

[[#char][Char]]:
+ char

[[#string][String]]:
+ &str
+ String

[[#boolean][Boolean]]
*** Int, Unsigned Int, Float
NOTE:
+ The ~x * y~ is multiplied using *Binary Multiplication* because *Arithmetic Multiplication*
  requires a lot more overhead and will be a big performance hit.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1.1;
    let y = 2.2;

    println!("x plus y is {}", x + y);
    println!("x times y is {}", x * y);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: x plus y is 3.3000000000000003
: x times y is 2.4200000000000004

NOTE:
+ 32bit floats/ints/unsigned ints take half as much memory as 64bit
+ 64bit floats/ints/unsigned ints are twice as precise as 32 bit

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let y: f32 = 10.0/3.0;
    println!("{}", y);

    let x: f64 = 10.0/3.0;
    println!("{}", x);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3.3333333
: 3.3333333333333335

We integers can be negative. And we can put seperators in our numarical values
for any of the three numeric types using ~_~. This is for syntactic convenience
and is read by the compiler as whitespaces that it will remove.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let negative_five: i32 = -5;
    let one_million: i32 = 1_000_000;

    println!("negative_five -> {}\none_million -> {}", negative_five, one_million);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: negative_five -> -5
: one_million -> 1000000

Arithmetic operation on integers will DISCARD any potential decimal values not
round them up/down.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let exactly_three = 10/3;
    println!("{}", exactly_three);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

If demoninator in a division operation is 0, then compiler will [[Panic][panic]]. Make
sure to prove a conditional to handle this case if you are not sure if
denominator results to 0.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let poof = 33/0;
    println!("{}", poof);
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src text
 error: this operation will panic at runtime
  --> src/main.rs:3:16
  |
 3 |     let poof = 33/0;
  |                ^^^^ attempt to divide `33_i32` by zero
  |
   = note: `#[deny(unconditional_panic)]` on by default
#+end_src

Dividing a float by 0 gives us infinity. This is because *Binary Divition* operation
is done on floats instead of *Arithmetic Division*.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let float_by_zero: f32 = 33.0/0.0;
    println!("{}", float_by_zero);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: inf

**** Convert numeric types
To convert a numeric type into another we use the ~as~ keyword.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    println!("{}", multiply(-3, 5));
}

fn multiply (x: i32, y: u32) -> i32 {
    // return x * y;
    return x * (y as i32);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: -15

*** Char
A ~char~ is a ~u32~ that has been Unicode validated.
*** String
*** Boolean
Booleans can be converted to ~u8~ using ~as~ because behind the scenes a boolean
is an 8 bit unsigned int. This is done because even though theoretically a
boolean can be represented in 1 bit, there are no such hardware with that precision
therefore booleans are instead represented by 1 byte.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let truth_behind_true = true as u8;
    let truth_behind_false = false as u8;

    println!("True -> {}", truth_behind_true);
    println!("False -> {}", truth_behind_false);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True -> 1
: False -> 0

**** Conditionals
The syntax for ~if{}~ ~else if{}~ ~else{}~ statements are as follows:

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let x = 1;

    if x == 1 {
        println!("x is 1");
    } else if x == 2 {
        println!("x is 2");
    } else {
        println!("x is something else");
    }
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: x is 1

These conditionals can be used to return a value.

NOTE:
+ If you dont understand whats happenning look at [[Expressions][Expressions]]
+ Both ~if{}~ and ~else{}~ must be given otherwise program wont compile
+ When ~if{}~ is used this way, its very similar to ternary operators in other
  languages

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let msg = if 5 > 1 {
        "Duh 5 is obviously greater than 1 genius!"
    } else {
        "Impossible outcome lol!"
    };
    println!("{}", msg);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Duh 5 is obviously greater than 1 genius!

** Type annotation
We can be explicit about what a type a variable will be. For f64 this is done
with the following syntax ~: f64~.

Its not mandatory but good practice to do so.

NOTE:
+ Rust does not have the ~any~ type that Python does
+ Rust does not have inheritance unlike C++
+ We can have a collection of multiple types using [[#enums][Enums]]

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let x: f64 = 2.2;

    println!("x is {}", x)
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: x is 2.2

** Specifying types in function parameter
We ALWAYS have to write out the type annotations for parameters when defining
functions.

We ALWAYS have to write out the return type of the function if said funtion returns an value. For f64 this is done
with the following syntax ~fn NAME() -> f64{}~.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let answer = multiply_both(1.1, 3.3);
    println!("Answer is {}", answer);
}

fn multiply_both(param_1: f64, param_2: f64) -> f64 {
    return param_1 * param_2;
}
#+end_src

* Collections
Collections can hold multiple variables. Collections in memory (in Rust) are
represented as tuples. They have no overhead/extra-metadata similar to Assembly.
Not all collections can be iterated over as not all of them have the ~iter()~ method
implemented.
** Elements to variables
Rust has a convenient way of assigning elements of collentions to variables:

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let point: (i32, i32) = (3, 5);

    let x = point.0;
    let y = point.1;

    println!("x is {}, y is {}", x, y);

    let (a, b) = point;

    println!("a is {}, y is {}", a, b);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: x is 3, y is 5
: a is 3, y is 5

For elements of collection that we dont want to assign we use the ~_~.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let point: (i32, i32) = (3, 5);
    let (a, _) = point;

    println!("a is {}", a);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: a is 3

** Tuple
Tuples are collections that can hold different datatypes in it.
Tuples can't change number of element at runtime, their size are always fixed.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let point: (u64, &str) = (3, "Hello");

    let index_0 = point.0;
    let index_1 = point.1;

    println!("index_0 is {}\nindex_1 is {}", index_0, index_1);
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: index_0 is 3
: index_1 is Hello

*** The ~Unit~ tuple
Since tuples size cannot be changed at runtime, if we define an
empty tuple it will always be empty.

NOTE:
Uses of this tuple:
+ If a function has no return value, such a tuple is returned
+ the ~fn main(){}~ function also uses this method in order to have
  no return value

#+begin_src rust
fn main() -> () {
    //let unit: () = ();
}
#+end_src

** Arrays
Arrays are the only one of the three collections that can be iterated over and must
have a consistent element data type.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let my_array: [u32; 5] = [3, 55, 21, 53, 78];
    println!("idx_0 --> {}", my_array[0]);
    println!("idx_4 --> {}", my_array[4]);

    // Iterating over an array
    let mut counter = 0;
    for _i in my_array.iter() {
        println!("Index no. {} --> {}", counter, my_array[counter]);
        counter = counter + 1;
    };
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: idx_0 --> 3
: idx_4 --> 78
: Index no. 0 --> 3
: Index no. 1 --> 55
: Index no. 2 --> 21
: Index no. 3 --> 53
: Index no. 4 --> 78

** Struct
Structs are named as opposed to indexed like Tuples/Arrays. They
can have different datatypes.
NOTE:
+ When naming structs always use camel case

#+begin_src rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i16,
    z: i8,
}

fn main() {
    let my_point: Point = Point {x: 11, y: 9, z: 7};

    println!("{}, {}, {}", my_point.x, my_point.y, my_point.z);

    let mut new_point: Point = Point {x: 11, y: 9, z: 3};
    println!("x --> {}", new_point.x);
    println!("z --> {}", new_point.z);
    // Changing value of ~y~
    new_point.y = 555;
    println!("y --> {}", new_point.y);

    // new_point(11, 9, 7);
    // let var_x = point::x;
    // println!("{}", var_x)
}

// fn new_point(x: i32, y: i16, z: i8) -> Point {
//     point{x: x, y: y, z: z}
// }

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 11, 9, 7
: x --> 11
: z --> 3
: y --> 555

** Vector
Vector, like Arrays, require type specification for every element. But unlike
Arrays, length of Vectors are not hardcoded.

NOTE:
Vectors and Arrays are vastly different, look at [[Memory]] for details.

#+begin_src rust
let years_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1995, 1998, 2000];
#+end_src

We can ~push()~ new elements into a vector and we can ~pop()~ elements out of a vector and
call its length via ~len()~:

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    let years_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1995, 1998, 2000];
    println!("Index 0 --> {}", years_vec[0]);
    println!("Length --> {}", years_vec.len());

    // NOTE: push() and pop() mutated vectors
    let mut years_vec_mutable: Vec<i32> = vec![1995, 1998, 2000];
    // push()
    years_vec_mutable.push(2021);
    println!("Length post push() --> {}", years_vec_mutable.len());
    println!("Index 2 post push() --> {}", years_vec_mutable[2]);
    println!("Index 3 post push() --> {}", years_vec_mutable[3]);
    // pop()
    years_vec_mutable.pop();
    println!("Length post pop() --> {}", years_vec_mutable.len());
    println!("Index 0 post pop() --> {}", years_vec_mutable[0]);
    println!("Index 1 post pop() --> {}", years_vec_mutable[1]);
    // println!("Index 2 --> {}", years_vec_mutable[2]); // This is out of bounds because I popped it
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Index 0 --> 1995
: Length --> 3
: Length post-pop() --> 4
: Index 2 --> 2000
: Index 3 --> 2021
: Length post-pop() --> 3
: Index 0 --> 1995
: Index 1 --> 1998

NOTE:
The return value of the ~len()~ is ~usize~. ~usize~ is either a ~u32~ or ~u64~ or
any other unsigned-int sizes depending on the system the code is being compiled for.

#+begin_src rust
let years_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1995, 1998, 2000];
let length: usize = years_vec.len();
#+end_src

* Enums
Unlike structs, enums allow variants of a specific
type.

For example:

#+begin_src rust
enum Color {                   // type
    Green,                      // variant
    Yellow,                     // variant
    Blue,                       // variant
}

let go = Color::Green;
let stop = Color::Red;
let slow_down = Color::Yellow;
#+end_src

We can have structs and/or tuples in Enum values like so:

#+begin_src rust
enum Color {                   // type
    Green,                      // variant
    Yellow,                     // variant
    Blue,                       // variant
    my_struct { x: i16, y: i16, z: String },
    my_tuple (i8, i8, i8),
}

let go = Color::Green;
let stop = Color::Red;
let slow_down = Color::Yellow;
let my_struct = Color::my_struct {x: 10, y: 100:, z: 33},
let my_tuple = Color::my_tuple (11, 23, 124),
#+end_src

* Pattern Matching
Is similar (but different) to a ~switch~ keyword from JavaScript. Rust uses the ~match~ keyword.

#+begin_src rust
let current_color = Color::Yellow;

match current_color {
    Color::Green => {
        println!("Its green");
    }
    Color::Yellow => {
        println!("Its yellow");
    }
    _ => {
        println!("Its none of these");
    }
}
#+end_src

While pattern matching an enum, we must specify cases for all the variants otherwise the code
wont compile. We can alleviate this by using something called *catch-all case*, denoted by ~_~
as shown in the code snippet above.
* Methods

#+begin_src rust
enum Color {                   // type
    Green,                      // variant
    Yellow,                     // variant
    Blue,                       // variant
    my_struct { x: i16, y: i16, z: String },
    my_tuple (i8, i8, i8),
}

impl Color {
    fn rgb(color: Color) -> (u8, u8, u8) {

    }
    fn new(r: u8, g: u8, b: u8) -> Color {

    }
}
#+end_src

* Option
Option is an enum with the following declaration:

#+begin_src rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),                    // the (T) is the payload
}
#+end_src

We have to put the type of our option in place of ~<T>~.

#+begin_src rust
let email: Option<String> = Some(email_str);
#+end_src

NOTE:
+ Whatever we put in the ~<T>~ can be used by the corresponding
  variants of the enum
+ We don't have to namespace Options
* Result
Result is similar to Option (which are possible absense of a value)
but represents an operation that could have failed.

#+begin_src rust
enum Result<O, E> {
    Ok(O),
    Err(E),                    // the (E) is the payload
}
#+end_src

Look at the codeblock below, it reads like:
+ ~success~ is an enum, and if operation succeeds then return
  back 42, because of ~Ok(42)~
+ ~failure~ is an enum, and if operation fails then return
  back a string, because of ~Err(str)~

#+begin_src rust
enum Result<O, E> {
    Ok(O),
    Err(E),                    // the (E) is the payload
}

let success: Result<i64, String> = Ok(43);
let failure: Result<i64, String> = Err(str);
#+end_src

NOTE:
+ We don't have to namespace Result

* Memory
The memory is a group of bits in sequential order.
We often choose to interpret it as an array of bytes (8 bits) as shown in the
diagram below:

[[./img/memory.png]]

** Stack
Stack in a segment of memory that is used as a pathway for passing around values
to functions. A global counter ~stack_length~ is also noted for reasons we will
see later. Lets look at the function defined below:

#+begin_src rust
fn increment_decrement(num: u8) {
    print_nums(num + 1, num - 1);
}

fn print_nums(x: u8, y: u8) { ... }

fn main() {
    increment_decrement(42);
}
#+end_src

When the ~increment_decrement()~ is called with the arg ~42~, the 0th index of the stack
gets populated with the value 42.

*Stack index*:
| 0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

*Current Stack length*: 1

*Stack value in corresponding index*:
| 42 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

When ~increment_decrement()~ executes, it knows where the argument is located in the stack
by pulling it out of memory like this: ~stack_bytes[stack_length - 1]~.

Now the value ~42~ is passed into ~print_nums()~ but is done as two seperate args, namely:
~42 + 1~ and ~42 - 1~. Therefore the stack will be populated with ~43~ and ~41~ in the following
expty index past ~index 0~.

*Stack index*:
| 0 | 1 | 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

*Current stack length*: 3

*Stack value in corresponding index*:
| 42 | 43 | 41 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

The values are passed into ~print_nums()~, which finds the location of the values (43 and 41)
in the stack by: ~stack_bytes[stack_length - 2]~ and ~stack_bytes[stack_length - 3]~ respectively.

NOTE:
If ~increment_decrement()~ returned a value then it'll reserve a a slot in the stack for
that value prior to argument being taken into the parameter, for example:

*Stack index*:
| 0 | 1 | 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

*Current stack length*: 3

*Stack value in corresponding index*:
| /reserved/ | 42 | 43 | 41 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

The number of slots reserved will depend on the size which must be known during compile time.

** Garbage
Once the execution is finished, the ~stack_length~ is set back to ~0~. Any values that
may be present in the un-indexed stack are no longer used, they are called *Garbage*.
** Heap
The Heap is another regieon of memory that is essentially a giant bucket of states.
It's used as a helper for Stack where the Stack can store data that are not static
in size.

Similar to the funtion in [[Stack]], but imagine the following:

#+begin_src rust
fn some_action(num: u8) -> Vec<u8> { ... }

let nums = some_action(30);
#+end_src

We have a chicked-and-egg problem here as the space for the returned value is reserved
during function call but it's impossible to know the size of the Vector before the instructions
that will eventually create the Vector finishes executing.

Datatypes that take dynamic space in memory have a /metadata/ struct associated with them that
holds the following values:
+ first_elem_index: usize
+ length: usize
+ capacity: usize

With the above detail in mind lets look at the following vector:

#+begin_src rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
#+end_src

Here the ~first_elem_index~ will be the index of the location in Heap where the first element
is stored. The ~length~ will be ~3~, since the vector has a length of 3.

*Heap*:
|     |     |     |     |    | v | v | v |      |     |      |     |     |
| ... | 234 | 111 | 390 | 32 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3098 | 123 | 2123 | 890 | ... |
|     |     |     |     |    | ^ | ^ | ^ |      |     |      |     |     |

NOTE:
If we want to ~push()~ a new value into ~nums~ then it may fail since the slot after the
last element of num is maybe populated by a value from another function/thread. When a situation
like this occurrs, the rust-runtime-system will move the entire vector to a different region in
the Heap. This has significant performance cost. We can specify how much space should be initially
allocated in the Heap using the ~capacity~ field in the /metadata/ struct like so:

#+begin_src rust
let nums = Vec::with_capacity(5);
#+end_src

This way the Head will look like this:
*Heap*:
|     |     |     |     |    | v | v | v | v          | v          |      |     |      |     |     |
| ... | 234 | 111 | 390 | 32 | 1 | 2 | 3 | /reserved/ | /reserved/ | 3098 | 123 | 2123 | 890 | ... |
|     |     |     |     |    | ^ | ^ | ^ | ^          | ^          |      |     |      |     |     |

This miminizes the instance where the program will do the performance-expensive reallocation of the
entire datatructure on the Heap.
